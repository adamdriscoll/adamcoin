Buying Adams can be done using [Tinyman](https://tinyman.org). You need some Algorand (ALGO) in order to make the trade for Adams. Below you'll find the steps necessary to trade Adams. 

First, you'll need an ALGO wallet. You can download the [Pera Wallet](https://perawallet.app/) from the Android or iOS app store. You can follow the step by step tutorial on [how to setup a wallet here](https://support.perawallet.app/en/article/create-a-new-algorand-account-on-pera-wallet-1ehbj11/).

Once you have a wallet, you'll need to purchase some ALGO. You can do so either by using a service like [Moonpay](https://www.moonpay.com/) or by purchasing ALGO in [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com). Using Moonpay is nice because it adds directly to your Pera Wallet. If you use Coinbase, you'll need to send your ALGO from your Coinbase account to your Pera Wallet. 

Next, head over to [TinyMan](https://tinyman.org) and click Connect a Wallet. Select Pera Wallet and then scan the QR code from the Pera Wallet app on your phone. 

Once you've paired your wallet to TinyMan, you can click the Swap button to trade ALGO for Adams. Click the select a token textbox and then click See all.
